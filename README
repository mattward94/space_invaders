This is my adaption of the classic Space Invaders game. I believe my game to be unique as the player is in control of an atomatically firing gun fending off swarms of space creatures from above.

Use the 'Left' and 'Right' arrows to control the player on the bottom of the screen. 

The original work that I have adapted is by https://github.com/cykod/AlienInvaders

The sources that I have used in my game are as follows:
